# frankensearch Architecture Overview

This document is the contributor-facing map of the current `frankensearch` workspace. It focuses on runtime behavior, crate boundaries, and the design choices that matter when you are changing code.

## 1) Workspace Crate Map (12 Crates)

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `frankensearch-core` | Shared contracts: traits, errors, config, canonicalization, query classes, telemetry types |
| `frankensearch-embed` | Embedder implementations and model discovery/cache/download glue |
| `frankensearch-index` | FSVI vector format, search kernels (brute force + optional ANN), index builders |
| `frankensearch-lexical` | Tantivy-backed `LexicalSearch` implementation |
| `frankensearch-fusion` | RRF fusion, blending, progressive two-tier search orchestration |
| `frankensearch-rerank` | Optional cross-encoder reranking (FlashRank/ONNX) |
| `frankensearch-storage` | FrankenSQLite metadata, dedup/content-hash, persistent embedding queue |
| `frankensearch-durability` | Repair trailer and durability workflows, including Tantivy/FSVI helpers |
| `frankensearch-fsfs` | Standalone CLI/TUI search product (`fsfs`) built on library crates |
| `frankensearch-tui` | Shared TUI framework primitives (screens/shell/input/replay/theme) |
| `frankensearch-ops` | Fleet/operations console crate on top of `frankensearch-tui` |
| `frankensearch` | Facade crate that re-exports public APIs across the workspace |

High-level dependency arrows:

## 2) End-to-End Data Flow

### Indexing path

```text
document
  -> canonicalize (NFC/cleanup)
  -> embed (fast tier)
  -> persist vectors in FSVI
  -> persist metadata/queue state in FrankenSQLite
  -> optional lexical indexing via Tantivy
```

### Query path

```text
query
  -> parse + classify
  -> embed query (fast tier)
  -> search vector index (FSVI; optional ANN)
  -> search lexical index (Tantivy)
  -> RRF fuse
  -> emit initial results
  -> embed/refine with quality model
  -> blend scores
  -> optional cross-encoder rerank
  -> emit refined results
```

Mermaid search flow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  q[Query] --> c[Canonicalize + Classify]
  c --> fe[Fast Embed]
  c --> lx[Tantivy Lexical Search]
  fe --> vs[Vector Search FSVI]
  vs --> rrf[RRF Fusion K=60]
  lx --> rrf
  rrf --> init[SearchPhase::Initial]
  init --> qe[Quality Embed]
  qe --> blend[Two-tier Blend]
  blend --> rr[Optional Rerank]
  rr --> refined[SearchPhase::Refined]
```

## 3) Two-Tier Strategy (Why It Exists)

The architecture intentionally separates speed and quality:

- Fast tier gets early, useful answers quickly (interactive latency budget).
- Quality tier spends more compute to improve ranking after initial display.

Practical effect:

- better perceived latency for users and agent workflows
- better final ranking than fast-only approaches
- graceful degradation when quality models are missing or fail

Progressive API contract:

- `SearchPhase::Initial`
- `SearchPhase::Refined`
- `SearchPhase::RefinementFailed`

This is implemented in the fusion/searcher lane and exposed to consumers through the facade and fsfs surfaces.

## 4) Storage Model

Three storage concerns are explicitly separated:

1. Vector storage: FSVI files (`frankensearch-index`)
2. Lexical storage: Tantivy index (`frankensearch-lexical`)
3. Metadata/job state: FrankenSQLite (`frankensearch-storage`)

Why split:

- each subsystem can optimize for its access pattern
- vector search remains SIMD/mmap focused
- metadata and queues stay transactional and durable
- lexical ranking keeps BM25 semantics and query parsing isolated

## 5) Durability Layer

`frankensearch-durability` adds corruption detection/repair primitives around persistent files, including:

- RaptorQ FEC sidecar materialization/validation for recoverability
- repair trailer I/O
- file/segment verification and repair orchestration
- durability metrics and health reporting

This layer is deliberately optional so lightweight deployments can skip its overhead, while higher-durability environments can enable it.

## 6) Async Runtime Model (asupersync, not tokio)

The workspace uses `asupersync` for async/concurrency contracts.

Operational implications:

- async functions receive a `Cx` capability context
- cancellation and scoped task lifetimes are part of normal control flow
- runtime behavior is explicit in API boundaries (especially embed/search/rerank paths)

Why it matters to contributors:

- do not add tokio/hyper/reqwest patterns
- preserve `Cx` plumbing in new async code
- keep cancellation-correct behavior when adding queues/workers/search phases

## 7) Key Design Decisions and Rationale

- f16 quantization for vector storage
  - reduces vector footprint materially while retaining ranking quality for cosine-style retrieval
- RRF with `K=60`
  - robust rank-based fusion across lexical and semantic lists without fragile score normalization coupling
- progressive iterator/phase model
  - enables fast-first UX with quality refinement as a second phase
- NaN-safe ordering in ranking operations
  - deterministic behavior even with problematic floating-point edge cases

These are foundational decisions; changes here require explicit measurement and migration planning.

## 8) Contributor Onramp: Where To Read Code First

Start with these files:

- `frankensearch/src/lib.rs` (facade surface and re-exports)
- `crates/frankensearch-core/src/lib.rs` (contracts/types)
- `crates/frankensearch-fusion/src/searcher.rs` (progressive orchestration)
- `crates/frankensearch-index/src/lib.rs` and `crates/frankensearch-index/src/two_tier.rs` (vector index/search)
- `crates/frankensearch-lexical/src/lib.rs` (BM25 integration)
- `crates/frankensearch-fsfs/src/main.rs` + `crates/frankensearch-fsfs/src/adapters/cli.rs` (standalone product surface)

Then inspect:

- `docs/fsfs-config-contract.md`
- `docs/fsfs-dual-mode-contract.md`
- `docs/fsfs-packaging-release-install-contract.md` (including host migration playbooks)
- `docs/fsfs-packaging-release-install-contract.md#upgrade-and-migration-compatibility-verification-strategy`
- `docs/ops-tui-ia.md#operator-runbook-production-use`
- `AGENTS.md`

## 9) Ops Control-Plane Data Flow + Contract Surface

The ops control-plane stack is intentionally contract-driven so host integrations and operator workflows stay deterministic.

```text
host app adapter
  -> telemetry envelope (schema + redaction policy)
  -> ingestion/store (FrankenSQLite raw + summarized windows)
  -> alert/slo/anomaly evaluators
  -> ops query API
  -> TUI screens (fleet/project/stream/history/explainability)
```

Key semantics:

- SLO and anomaly state MUST use one shared taxonomy across all hosts.
- Error severity and recovery guidance are contract-defined, not ad hoc.
- Replay artifacts and reason codes are required for incident triage.

Core contract references:

| Contract | What it defines |
|---|---|
| `docs/control-plane-interface.md` | API surface and data model for fleet/project/stream queries |
| `docs/slo-anomaly-contract.md` | SLO budgets, anomaly lifecycle, and reason fields |
| `docs/control-plane-error-contract.md` | Severity classes, recovery guidance, and UI escalation |
| `docs/observability-contract.md` | Event taxonomy (`decision/alert/degradation/transition/replay_marker`) |
| `docs/evidence-jsonl-contract.md` | Replay-safe evidence schema + redaction policy |
| `docs/cross-epic-telemetry-adapter-lockstep-contract.md` | Host adapter lockstep/versioning/conformance requirements |

## 10) Scope Notes

## 11) Sprint 2 Release-Readiness Snapshot (`bd-3vw3`)

Snapshot time: `2026-02-15T04:35Z` (from `br` + `bv --robot-*` outputs).

### Gate Decision Records

| Gate / Policy bead | Status | Closed at (UTC) | Decision record |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bd-ehuk` (release gate) | `closed` | `2026-02-15T03:44:03.768970671Z` | Close reason records that blocker dependencies were closed and interaction-matrix artifacts/tests/sign-off prerequisites were satisfied. |
| `bd-1pkl` (composition-matrix policy gate) | `closed` | `2026-02-15T04:07:04.505835470Z` | Policy gate marked complete; required composition-linkage governance is now closed. |
| `bd-ls2f` (reproducibility contract) | `closed` | `2026-02-15T03:42:53.427719531Z` | Close reason records `env.json` + `repro.lock` contract implementation plus validator-backed coverage. |

`bd-3vw3` blocker check: `13/13` `blocks` dependencies are currently `closed`.

### Composition Coverage Evidence

| Coverage lane | Evidence surface | Replay/diagnostic contract |
|---|---|---|
| Unit interaction invariants | `crates/frankensearch-fusion/tests/interaction_unit.rs` | Deterministic lane/oracle assertions with stable lane IDs and reason codes. |
| Integration interaction matrix | `crates/frankensearch-fusion/tests/interaction_integration.rs` | High-risk lane matrix emits replay-ready bundles and failure summaries. |
| Multi-controller composition harness | `crates/frankensearch-fusion/tests/composition_harness.rs` | Deterministic fallback/ordering composition checks across controller combinations. |
| Unified e2e artifact schema | `docs/e2e-artifact-contract.md` | Canonical `manifest.json`, `env.json`, `repro.lock`, `replay_command.txt`, plus CI interaction-matrix gate expectations. |

### Risk Ledger, Known Limitations, and Fallback Playbooks

| Risk ID | Residual limitation | Mitigation / fallback playbook |
|---|---|---|
| `R-01` | Active downstream delivery tracks still open (`bd-2hz`, `bd-2yu.8`, `bd-2w7x.12`). | Use `bv --robot-next`/`--robot-triage` to prioritize unblockers; keep strict bead claiming + reservation discipline. |
| `R-02` | Not all producer lanes are in `adopted` state under the unified artifact contract yet. | Treat `docs/e2e-artifact-contract.md` as source of truth; require replay bundle completeness (`manifest/env/repro/replay`) on failing lanes. |
| `R-03` | Progressive search quality lane can degrade under timeout/failure conditions. | Preserve `Initial` phase UX and route through explicit degradation paths (`SearchPhase::RefinementFailed`, `fast_only`, `skip_reason`). |

### Dependency-Graph Health Revalidation (`bv`)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Open issues | `23` |
| Actionable issues | `19` |
| Blocked issues | `4` |
| In-progress issues | `12` |
| Cycle count | `0` |
| Health trend | `improving` |

Current highest-impact unblock candidates remain single-hop unblockers (`bd-2hz`, `bd-2w7x.12`, `bd-2yu.8`), each directly unblocking one downstream item.

### Sprint Retrospective Delta (`bv --robot-diff --diff-since HEAD~30`)

| Delta metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Open issue delta | `-20` |
| Closed issue delta | `+88` |
| Blocked issue delta | `0` |
| Issues closed in diff window | `22` |
| Backlog health trend | `improving` |
| Regression-gate proxy (`bv --robot-alerts`) | `0 alerts` (`critical=0`, `warning=0`) |

This release-readiness snapshot closes the Sprint-2 composition hardening bookkeeping loop by linking gate decisions, deterministic interaction coverage, artifact/replay requirements, and graph-health deltas in one auditable location.

This document is intentionally a high-signal architecture map, not a full API reference. Detailed behavior, config invariants, and integration rules live in crate-level docs and the contracts under `docs/`.
